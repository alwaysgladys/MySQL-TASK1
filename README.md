# Update/Modification of tables

## Introduction

The Main aspect of working with **SQL** databases, particularly MySQL, is the ability to update and modify tables. This task is a guide to understanding the manipulation of data within MySQL tables, which entails utilizing SQL to effect changes to both the table structure and the data it contains.

## Problem:
1. Rename the tables to Employee_Info and Employee_Salary
2. Change the ID columns to Employee_ID
3. Create a new column in the Employee_Salary named “Department”
4. For employees with the following ID’s, update their department with the ones specified 
- 1,3,7 IT
- 2,5,9 Advertising
- 4,6,8,10 Communications
5.	Change the data type of the IDs in both columns to Text data type
6.	Run a query that returns the month, Year and day each employee came into the company
7.	Return a query that adds 10 years to the year the employees came into the company as their year_of_exit.

The above snapshot shows the first table with the name "Employee Info" which comprises of the Employee ID, Name, Age, Contract duration, Date of Entry and Year of Exit; which we got by adding the interval of 10 years to the employees Date of Entry.

Then the second table with the name "Employee Salary" which we changed the name from "Staff Salary" comprises of the Employee ID, Salary, Yearly Increment and Department; which we added as a new column and updated with "Advertising" where the ID = 2,5,9, then "IT" where the ID =1,3,7 and "communications" where the ID =4,6,10. 


## Conclusion

The process of updating and modifying tables within **SQL** is an essential aspect of database management. 

Through tasks such as renaming tables, changing columns, inserting values into tables, one gains essential skills in database manipulation using **SQL**.
